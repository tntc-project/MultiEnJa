# Human translation for SDset-46

This directory contains the English-to-Japanese translation for SDset-46 produced by professional translators at a translation service provider (TSP) following the standard translation process (ISO/TC37, 2015).  In addition to the final product, we include the translation brief (written in Japanese) prepared before starting translation and intermediate versions of translations as described below.

* Result of ***Translation*** process (suffixed with v1, v4, v7) produced by translators.
* Result of ***Check*** process (suffixed with v2, v5, v8) checked and revised by checkers who are not the above translator.
* Result of ***Review*** process (suffixed with v3, v6, v9) reviewed and revised by reviewers who are also different from the above translator and checker.

As one can imagine from the version numbering (v1 to v9), the TSP made iterations in case the checker and/or reviewer found issues that required the translator's confirmation to resolve, following the standard translation process (ISO/TC37, 2015).  A total of 7 translators, 3 checkers, and 2 reviewers were involved in the creation of this dataset.
