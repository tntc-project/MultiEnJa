# Machine translation and manual post-editing for SDset-46

This directory contains the English-to-Japanese translation for SDset-46 produced through machine translation and manual post-editing by a translation service provider (TSP) following a simplified version of the standard post-editing process (ISO/TC37, 2017).  The contents of the subdirectories are as follows.

* [en-ja.mt](en-ja.mt): Machine translation outputs generated by [TexTra](https://mt-auto-minhon-mlt.ucri.jgn-x.jp/) on December 2020.
* [en-ja.pe](en-ja.pe): Post-edited version of the above machine translation output.

## Light post-edit

Due to our limited budget, we conducted only a light post-edit process, a simplified version of the standard post-editing process (ISO/TC37, 2017).  Specifically, the post-editors were instructed to follow the TODOs and Non-TODOs below.

* TODOs:
	* Make sure that the translation correctly conveys the information in the source document, adding/deleting nothing.
	* Make sure that the translation is grammatical.
* Non-TODOs: if the machine translation has correctly captured the meaning of the source document
	* Do not check the authorized translation/spelling of terms.
	* Do not comply with stylistic rules specific to the document type (e.g., sentence-ending forms).
	* Do not normalize spelling (e.g., okurigana variants, kanji/hiragana variants), punctuation, hyphenation, symbols, and so forth.
	* Do not apply other rules just for formatting.
