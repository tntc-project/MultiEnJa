# Unpolished/Polished translation pairs for the SDs

This directory contains English-to-Japanese translation for [the English SDs](../source-document) produced by professional translators at a translation service provider (TSP).
Aiming at observing actual examples exhibiting art in human translation (or translation strategies), we constrained the process as follows.

* First, we obtained [unpolished translation](en-ja.unpolished) with the following instruction.
	* It must be grammatial and accurately convey the information in the SD.
	* It should be literal as much as possible.  For instance, the order of the words and phrases are as close to as those in the SD.
    * Its quality in terms of fluency with respect to skopos (Vermeer, 2004), norm, register, and text type, as well as cohesiveness (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) is not necessarily extremely high.
* Then, we obtained [polished translation](en-ja.polished) through revising the unpolished translation.
	* It must adhere [the given translation blief](../human-translation/en-ja.brief).
	* It must be fluent and cohesive as if it has been originally written in the target language.  This includes adjustments of information quantity considering the potential readers: e.g., information obvious for the readers should be omitted, while those unfamiliar for the reader should be complemented.

Please refer to Yamamoto et al. (2023) for the detail of the process.
