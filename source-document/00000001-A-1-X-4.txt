Management Comments:
Jun Zhu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The9, said, "Red 5 launched Firefall in July 2014 in North America and Europe. We have high expectations for Firefall in the China market. In August 2014, Shanghai Oriental Pearl Culture Development Co. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Oriental Pearl (Group) Co., Ltd. (SH: 600832), closed its investment in Red 5 and became a minority shareholder of Red 5. Also in August 2014, Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd. (QIHU) and us established a 50-50 joint venture System Link Corporation Limited to publish and operate Firefall in China for a five-year term. Under this license agreement, System Link is expected to pay to us no less than an aggregate of US$160 million including license fee and royalties during the term of the agreement. All these show the great potential of Firefall in China. We are dedicating our best resources to prepare for the launch of Firefall in China and we target to launch Firefall in China in the second half of 2015. In addition, we are also planning to launch several mobile games in 2015. In August 2014, we sold Huopu Cloud, a subsidiary which developed and held a proprietary web game, for a total consideration of RMB200 million. This sale has proven our in-house game development capability has been recognized by the market."
Discussion of The9's Unaudited 2014 Second Half Results
Net Revenues
Our net revenues in the second half of 2014 amounted to RMB36.9 million (US$5.9 million), representing an increase of 34.4% from RMB27.4 million (US$4.4 million) in the first half of 2014 and a decrease of 37.2% from RMB58.7 million (US$9.5 million) in the second half of 2013. The increase over the first half of 2014 was mainly due to increase of revenue from Firefall in North America and Europe, and partly offset by decrease of revenue from various MMO, web and social games in China. The decrease from the second half of 2013 was mainly due to the decrease of revenue from Planetside 2.
Gross Loss
Our gross loss in the second half of 2014 amounted to RMB7.2 million (US$1.2 million), compared with RMB14.3 million (US$2.3 million) and RMB5.2 million (US$0.8 million) in the first half of 2014 and in the second half of 2013, respectively. The gross loss in the second half of 2014 reflected lower level of revenue generated coupled with the continued incurrence of a relatively fixed portion of our costs, such as overhead, depreciation and rental charges.

In the second half of 2014, our operating expenses, excluding gain from disposal of subsidiaries, were RMB151.8 million (US$24.5 million), which decrease by 0.8% from RMB153.0 million (US$24.7 million) in the first half of 2014 and decrease by 39.9% from RMB252.6 million (US$40.7 million) in the second half of 2013. The decrease compared to the first half of 2014 was primarily due to the net effect of the increase in marketing expenses in the second half relating to the launch of Firefall in the North America and Europe, and reversal of an allowance provided on a long-term receivable from a supplier recognized in the second half of 2013. The decrease compared to the second half of 2013 was primarily due to the cost cutting on product development, marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, and the reversal of an allowance provided on a long-term receivable from a supplier recognized in the second half of 2013. In addition, in the first half of 2014, we also recorded a gain on disposal of subsidiaries of RMB165.4 million (US$26.7 million) in the second half of 2014 in connection with the disposal of Huopu Cloud Computing Terminal Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, as well as certain other subsidiary, which was recorded as a deduction to operating expense.
Interest Income
Interest income in the second half of 2014 was RMB1.9 million (US$0.3 million), compared to RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million) in the first half of 2014 and RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million) in the second half of 2013. The fluctuation of interest income was typically in line with our cash balances.
