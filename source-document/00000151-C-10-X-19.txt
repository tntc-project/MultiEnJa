Standard 4.2.5
PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING STANDARD FOR eggs AND EGG PRODUCT
(Australia only)
Purpose and commentary
This Standard sets out a number of food safety requirements for the primary production and processing of eggs, egg pulp and other egg product for human consumption. At the primary production stage, businesses that produce eggs must implement measures to control the food safety hazards and must be able to trace their individual eggs for sale. Businesses that process eggs or egg product must control their food safety hazards and must be able to trace their individual eggs and the egg pulp. It is the responsibility of these businesses not only to comply with this Standard but also to be able to demonstrate compliance.
