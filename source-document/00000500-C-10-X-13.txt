Agriculture, forestry and fishing
Businesses that grow crops, raise animals, grow and harvest timber, and harvest fish and other animals from farms or their natural habitats, fall within the agriculture industry.
There are two basic activities captured in this category:
production, eg raising beef cattle, off shore prawn fishing, felling of plantation trees
support services to production, eg fruit picking, wool classing.

Top causes of injury
There are a vast range of activities and workplaces within this industry. Each workplace presents its own safety challenges.
But, across the industry, common causes of injuries are:
unsafe use of quad bikes
manual tasks and repetitive motion
hearing loss due to noise
incorrect and unsafe use of hazardous chemicals
injuries from farm animals.
Common hazards
Working in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry is physically demanding and workers face challenges of working outdoors, working in all types of weather and conditions, and often working in regionally isolated areas. These aspects of the work complicate the safety risks.
Each workplace is different though. You need to know what the hazards are in your business so you can assess the risk they pose.
To help you get started, we've prepared information on how to identify hazards and manage the risks common to the agriculture sector, including:
quad bikes
noise
manual handling
animal handling
electrical work and working near overhead powerlines
biosecurity hazards
tree work (arboriculture)
