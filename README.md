## Introduction

This repository contains 46 examples of English source documents (SDs) in various content domains that are often dealt with by translation service providers (TSPs) and several types of translation-related derivatives that we have annotated and produced aiming to analyze the norms and competences in the translation process.

## Contents

Textual data of source documents are found [here](source-document).

For all of them, we have so far produced the following types of derivatives (See README.md in each directory for the details).
* [Professional translation](human-translation)
* [Post-edited machine translation outputs](MT-PE)
* [Unpolished/Polished translation pairs](unpolished-polished)

Figure 1 summarizes the processes of producing these heterogeneous translations and what can be analyzed by comparing some of them.
* MT outputs vs. their post-edited version: the issues of MT
* Human translation (HT) vs. MT+PE: the gap between what can be assured by ISO/TC37 (2015) and ISO/TC37 (2017)
* Draft/unpolished translation vs. final/polished translation: the art in human translation (or translation strategies)

## Todo

* Include other types of derivatives.
* Extend the number of documents as well as translation directions.
