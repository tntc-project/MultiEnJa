## Introduction

This repository contains 46 examples of English source documents (SDs) in various content domains that are often dealt with by translation service providers (TSPs) and several types of translation-related derivatives that we have annotated and produced aiming to analyze the norms and competences in the translation process.

## Contents

Textual data of source documents are found [here](source-document).

For all of them, we have so far produced the following types of derivatives (See README.md in each directory for the details).
* [Professional translation](human-translation)
* [Post-edited machine translation outputs](MT-PE)

## Todo

* Include other types of derivatives.
* Extend the number of documents as well as translation directions.
